Well, it’s hard to decide because there are a lot of factors such as what you want to do with it, what you want to learn after, where you will use this language and do you have any experience.

I will try highlight needs of the masses… So, there are three main ways for you:

## 1. Kidding with Scratch
It’s the best solutins for people who want to try how is it to programming. With **Scratch** you don’t need to learn anything, it’s very intuitive.

## 2. C++ / C# / Swift or Java
This way will be perfect if you want to become a little GOD… Proficiency in any of languages above (C++ / C# / Objective C / Java) will give you awesome opportunities in:

**C++** – in the most operational systems (windows, iOS, linux)

**C#** – in windows

**Swift** – in iOS

**Java** – in Android

…


## 3. JavaScript
Not to be confused with Java, JavaScript is primarily a client-side scripting language used for interface-level development. JavaScript is compatible in all browsers and is used to create interactive web applications, often through libraries such as jQuery and interface systems such as AngularJS, Ember.js, React and others.

JavaScript can also be used as a server language via the Node.js. Not so long ago, Node.js was still very young, but since then its community has grown dramatically, and now you can find a lot of resources on the Internet.
You can also create hybrid mobile applications using JavaScript using frameworks such as phonegap, while React Native from Facebook allows you to create high-performance mobile applications with JavaScript.

## Conclusion
If you newbie or just want to create applications you solution is JavaScript, but if you want to dive deeper and become are really skillful you should choose one of the languages from second way.

Anyway it will good choice to learn how to programming… Good luck!
