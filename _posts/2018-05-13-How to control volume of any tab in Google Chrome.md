Do you listen to quite a lot of music or audio on your web browser and strugling with volume balance of each source? If so this article is for you =)

Recently I developed [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/volume-manager/kakeffogmhndegdafnbobknemagiikak) that is going to help you.

Below I describe how to release full potential of of using it.
 
## Volume Mixer for Chrome tabs
Did you even troubled with finding the resource of sound among numerous tabs? Sure, everyone experienced it.  
The extension will show you what tabs are playing audio right now. What's more, you are able to **control volume** of that anoying tab. All what you need is to switch to the tab (by clicking on relevant button) and use shortcuts or slider. 

## Volume Booster 
Sometimes video or audio sound is too low to hear, but it's already 100% of the speakers volume.  
Here our extension rescue us again... As you, probably, already saw there are additional smaller slider near the regular, bigger. _It allows you to bost volume up to 800%!_ But you should tolerant to you speakers, you can _burn them out_ <3

## Shortcuts to control sound
By default **Volume Manager** uses hotkeys:
- `Ctrl + Q` or `Ctrl + arrow-rigth` to volume UP 
- `Alt + Q` or `Ctrl + arrow-left` to volume DOWN
By the way, you can enable or disable it anytime on the options page of the extension.

## Additional features and settings
Right Click on the icon -> Options to go to the Settings.
### Extended
1. **Mute all tabs** _(Take ABSOLUTE control on what you should to hear!)_
2. Current **volume level** of a tab in it's name
3. Full screen mode for videos (if you feel whathing videos buggy - turn it off) 
4. On/Off shortcuts

## Conclusion
Hope you will find my little creation usefull. 
Also feel free to suggest new features or tell me about bug or even say "thank you" in the comments.
